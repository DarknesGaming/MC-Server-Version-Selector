# Minecraft Server Version Selector

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is just a simple Windows batch application that will allow you to select which Minecraft server version you want to use. Because this is a batch application, this will NOT run on Mac OS X (as of Fall 2016, macOS), UNIX or Linux operating systems.

To avoid copyright issues, I do NOT provide any jar files that allow this tool to work! You absolutely MUST supply those yourself. I prefer to maintain this project rather than get it disabled by GitHub for DMCA complaints.

## Format

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following format is acceptable:

spigot-1.10.2.jar

craftbukkit.1.10.2.jar

These are just examples. However, only the latest versions of any major Minecraft release (Ex: 1.8) are currently supported.

The jar files must follow this format, or the tool will not work.

The current version of this program is 0.2.1.

The tool does not yet support Cauldron, or Plain Vanilla yet.

## Usefulness

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This batch file is SUPER useful if you have more than one version of a jar file for a Minecraft server, and you don't want to have to change the code. The file I created eliminates that problem 99.9% of the time. You having an outdated version of a major release (1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.10) is the .1%.

## Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are satisfied with my work, then I have done something right. If you have issues with this, please open an issue ticket describing what went wrong.

Do NOT open any tickets for these reasons:
* Outdated version of a major release not supported.
* Constant crashing
* Not working on any other OS but Windows (I made a VERY clear warning about this!)

Any ticket that is opened for those reasons will be closed immediately.
