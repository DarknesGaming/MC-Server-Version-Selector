# Minecraft Server Version Selector

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is just a simple Windows batch application that will allow you to select which Minecraft server version you want to use. Only works on Windows.

To avoid copyright issues, I do NOT provide any jar files that allow this tool to work! You absolutely MUST supply those yourself. I prefer to maintain this project rather than get it disabled by GitHub for DMCA complaints.

## Format

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following format is acceptable:

spigot-1.10.2.jar

The jar files must follow this format, or the tool will not work.

The current version of this program is 0.1.0.

The tool only works with Spigot and Minecraft versions 1.9.4 and 1.10.2.
